    The haunted spectre once said: <i>&raquo;THE GOVERNMENT IS REAL!!!&laquo;</i> That's really unfortunate. It also once said:
    <i>&raquo;I NEED HELP!!!!&laquo;</i> That's not as unfortunate, but also not ideal. Talking about idealism, left comes before right.
    All countries implementing this differently suck.

    Remember Joe? Joe snake. It has a mommy. Two to be precise. Snakes are fun. Especially when they hunt apples. However, Joe's mommies
    were different. They died before Joe's origin. He was born in a laboratory. Level 11. The wizard felt like Joe's dad. What a nice
    human. Shortly after that he created the dragon rider. The communistic community hated him. Kicking is still meta. Did you know
    that S2DnG is a very communistic game? There is no money, just tools and workers. If you want to find out more, do it. Otherwise,
    read <a href="https://github.com/NotYou404/ts2-anniversary-guide">my guide</a>.

    Don't be like John. He's very schizophrenic. Schizophrenia is his religion. Just like Günter. He likes hiding in dark cover
    because he has no ears. They got stolen by the lootgoblins. Those live with Satan. Just like John's uncle. He pooped while
    eating and got fisted.

    Do you know these days when you wake up and wish you didn't? I have trustworthy sources proofing this to be normal, easily
    curable using hydrocyanic acid. <i>&raquo;When the voices get loud, I'm turning them down&laquo;</i> someone once said.
    That indeed works, using the technique described above. On the other hand, honey tastes good. Getting back to communistic
    thoughts. I can barely grasp them due to the vast amount of cake. Everything I can hear is the scream of a worker who is
    working. His boss is a rich capitalist who never works. Sounds fair, doesn't it? I can feel that the kicking meta might
    come to an end very soon. All you need for hydrocyanic acid is hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen. Chemistry outplayed. Did you know
    that te Christians killed way more people than the Satanists? Not sharing their opinions really is a war crime. Pastafarians in
    contrary are fine with the knowledge, other religions are mislead. No violence, no harassment and no threats. At the same time,
    the fog starts running, making the vision clearer. It sees colors. Squares, triangles and irregularly shaped ellipsoids. Who
    <i>&raquo;it&laquo;</i> is? No idea. Maybe it (the haunted spectre) knows. It won't tell us though. It's not real. Even though I
    cannot tell wether I am real. Fact is: Suckers suck.

    Delta is a difference. The symbol of delta as difference is a triangle Δ, just like Illuminati. That means, both math and
    people writing out <i>&raquo;jgl diff&laquo;</i> believe into the best of the best. Earth is a flat pyramid. By the way, the FSM looks
    truly amazing on top of a pyramid. Conspiracies are cool. I kinda miss February.
    <br><br><br>
    Being high is cool overall. However you should use your potential energy to jump down, gaining kinetic energy to hit the ground faster
    and harder. Did you know that the formula for thermic energy is \( m * c * ΔT \)? <i>&raquo;MORE ILLUMINATI!!!&laquo;</i>.
    Definitely a proof of their existence. THEY manage our climate, according to the formula. \( T \) means tomb. That's were capitalists
    are gonna land. \( m \) is the magnifier. Earth is a pyramid, meaning the poles are fake. \( c \) is cucumber tastiness. They're not.
    That being said, our formula \( m * c * ΔT \) equals Δ. Do you need any other proof? Physics outplayed.

    Noodles are better than rice and potatoes. But there's more: I also have a reason for this. Rice usually grows in socialistic
    and even capitalistic countries who pretend to be communistic. Potatoes originally come from those areas exporting cocain.
    However, they only make me feel a bit high. Noodle on the other hand grow on trees. Biology outplayed.
    <br><br><br>
    It feels like I'm missing one more thing. Even if, it doesn't matter. By the way, if I ever stop writing this, it's probably due to
    the kinetic energy.

    Have you ever used a computer before? Probably not, since you are reading this. But if you did, you likely heard of programmers. Pah!
    Do you actually think computer science is real? If it was, why would they name a language after a LETTER?? Also, computers were
    designed to do MATHS, not to be programmed. If you want to print() something, use a freaking PEN! Sorry, no curse words. Do you want
    to tell me that <i>&raquo;code checks if a metadata is empty using loadash isEmpty but this particular file has resources = [{}] which
    doesn't pass the check&laquo;</i> isn't a NONSENSICAL STATEMENT??? Having funny colored letters inside a black window? WITCHES!!! Who
    even wants to deal with COMPILATION ERRORS?! Why would I want an IMAGE of something useful? If computer science was real, why did nobody
    ever do something like this: while(True): print(money);? Computer science outplayed, stop fooling us.
