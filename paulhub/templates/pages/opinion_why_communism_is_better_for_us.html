    A spectre goes around in Europe. The spectre of communism. Poor spectre, nobody likes it. It is very sad and depressed. Due to sadness and depression,
    the spectre wants to die by fall damage. However, it doesn't take any. How unfortunate. Talking about fortune, the spectre doesn't know what that means.
    Enough talking about fortune. Fact is, that every bad government decision is democracy's fault. Stop! Don't talk about demo(n)s, the spectre is being
    haunted by them in its dreams. That makes it a haunted spectre.
    <br><br><br>
    We're all haunted. Haunted by sussy sand and gravel. <i>&raquo;Vote for communism!&laquo;</i> they scream. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE THEM!
    <br><br><br>
    In this dark, cold winter we all wish to be a haunted spectre. Not. Ha, haha. Whatever. Do you feel bad for the haunted spectre? L. As if it mattered.
    There is nothing we can do. Or is there? No.
    <br><br><br>
    How does it feel to buy bread for a dollar? Correct, it doesn't. This is because Ira Spectra. Go help free the haunted spectre from its demons.
    <br><br>
    This was the introduction.
    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
    Many think the communism isn't great. Thats cap. Only with communism people are happy. Trust me bro. To the haunted spectres glory, bread doesn't
    taste that well. But that doesn't matter. <i>&raquo;Giv bread!&laquo;</i> they say. Who's they? Only the haunted spectre knows. What a tragedy.
    <br><br><br>
    Why am I writing this? I don't know. As I'm always saying, don't ask questions. Am I crazy? No, but I was crazy once. They locked me into a room, a
    rubber room. Talking about rats, they make me crazy. Crazy? Stop calling me crazy. The haunted spectre is crazy. Because the states of the holy Europe
    are haunting it. Ok, I already said too much. The voices are getting louder. The voices, heard by the haunted spectre. They are real. Unlike the cake.
    I mean, it's moist, but eh. Did you know that the haunted spectre is suffering from depressions? Oh, I probably told you already. I'm very thankful for
    auto correct. What a gift.
    <br><br><br>
    One day the haunted spectre went into a club. It tried to find friends, but nobody liked it. That's a lie, it never went to a club.
    <br><br><br>
    Let's talk about sussy sand and gravel again.
    <br><br><br>
    I'm receiving a message by the haunted spectre. Never mind, it's just the wind. It's really cloudy out there. Just like the haunted spectre's dreams.
    <br><br><br>
    Ever saw a rich man wasting their money on useless stuff? Probably not. That's why the communism is great. Nothing changes.
    <br><br><br>
    Ever looked into a mirror thinking, <i>&raquo;Why am I so ugly?&laquo;</i> I didn't, I never look into mirrors.
    <br><br><br>
    I'm digressing from the topic. Communism is so good, because you can't be poor. That reminds me of something. I am poor.  What an unfortunate given.
    If you want to help me out I'd be really happy. You can start by despawning. Right away. By the way, the haunted spectre is like me. Maybe I am the
    haunted spectre? I'm hearing way too many things to answer this. Can you believe this?
    <br><br><br>
    In <sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> of the world, workers proofed to be fine without capitalists. However, capitalists never proved to be fine without workers.
    For this reason, bread is better.
    <br><br><br>
    I just can't believe this is happening. The haunted spectre used to have a family! It's snake was really handsome. It called it Joe. Joe snake. What a
    cute name! The haunted spectre did everything for Joe snake. It petted Joe, Fed Joe, ate Joe. That's it, nothing else happened. No one has been hurt.
    No one has been raped. How sad, isn't it? No one ever remembered Joe. Joe snake.
    <br><br><br>
    One of the haunted spectre's biggest dreams is to be real. Really real. Not a symbol of good politics. Will this dream ever be fulfilled? Kennedy
    decides. Just blame it all on him. It's alright.
